These allow users to upload an existing image to guide the AI in terms of composition (Structure) or visual style, providing a level of control that can be particularly useful for brand consistency or specific artistic visions.

Importantly, Adobe has trained Firefly exclusively on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain material. This approach addresses some of the ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art and makes Firefly a safe choice for commercial applications.

As of early 2024, Adobe Firefly is free to use, although this may change in the future as Adobe finalizes its pricing model for the tool.
